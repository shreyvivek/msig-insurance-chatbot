## 🎯 What Makes It Different

### Traditional Insurance Chatbot:
- "What is your destination?"
- "What is your travel date?"
- "Here are 3 plans to choose from."
- "Please select one."

### WanderSure (Alex):
- "Ooh, Tokyo! 🎌 I've been dying to go there! The cherry blossoms in spring are AMAZING, but honestly, it's beautiful year-round. Have you thought about what you want to do? I know this incredible hidden ramen spot..."

Then seamlessly:
- "...and speaking of protection, since you're going skiing, I'd recommend the Silver plan - it covers up to $50k for medical, which is perfect since 80% of ski accidents in Japan cost more than $30k. Want me to break down the options?"

## 🎨 Example Conversations

### Scenario 1: Planning a Trip
**User:** "I'm thinking about going to Japan"

**Alex:** "OMG Japan! 🎌 I'm SO excited for you! Are you going for the cherry blossoms? Or maybe you're a foodie and want to explore the amazing food scene? I know this incredible spot in Tokyo that locals go to for the BEST sushi...

...and hey, since you're planning this, we should make sure you're protected! Japan has amazing healthcare, but it can be expensive for tourists. Want me to suggest the perfect plan based on what you're planning to do?"

### Scenario 2: Insurance Question
**User:** "What does trip cancellation cover?"

**Alex:** "Great question! So trip cancellation basically covers you if something unexpected happens and you can't go on your trip. Like if you get sick, or a family emergency, or your flight gets cancelled...

Here's what's covered under TravelEasy [Policy: TravelEasy, Section 3.2]:
- Medical emergencies preventing travel
- Death in immediate family
- Natural disasters
- And more!

Pro tip: Make sure you buy it within 14 days of booking for maximum coverage! 

Speaking of trips - where are you planning to go? 😊"
